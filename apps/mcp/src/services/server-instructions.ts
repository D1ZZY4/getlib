 * Server instructions string rendered into the MCP server.instructions field.

 *
 * BUDGET: Claude Code truncates server instructions around 2 KB. The previous
 * version was 5.3 KB, so the routing table — the part that actually changes
 * tool selection — was cut off before the model ever saw it. Everything here
 * earns its bytes: the routing table first, prose only where it prevents a
 * wrong call. Keep the output under INSTRUCTIONS_BYTE_BUDGET; the unit test
 * enforces it.

# Rules

- The message names a library: resolve it, never ask which one.
- gl_search is the catch-all, not the default — prefer gl_best_practices for a named library.
- Give topic a real subject ("row level security", not "best practices") — it drives retrieval.
- Registry is Elastic-2.0: look up specific libraries, never enumerate or dump it.`;
